A full-stack application designed to help users find and plan their career paths.

## 📝 About The Project

This application acts as a personal career advisor. It guides users through a simple multi-step process to find a job role and learning path that best fits their profile.

The app asks the user to provide their:
* **Skills:** A comprehensive checklist of technical and soft skills.
* **Interests:** The industries and fields they are passionate about.
* **Work Experience:** Their current professional level (Entry, Mid, Senior).

Based on this input, the application provides personalized job recommendations, complete with a "match score," salary estimates, skills analysis, and a visual career path to help users plan their next steps.
